# TTT-Disguised-Crowbar
It's a crowbar! It's a shotgun! It's a Disguised Crowbar!

I originally created this for a TTT server I used to manage, but we haven't been doing that whole TTT server thing for a while. This is one of my favorite weapons ever, and would love to see it in more and more servers!
